				<p>I have founded four high-technology companies in the film and television industry. The companies have been small but successful, leading to an EMMY award and two successful acquisitions by public companies.</p>
				<p>I was a research professor at the University of Virgina from 2006-2021 and while there&nbsp;directed a number of academic efforts for K-12 educators and scholars that have won numerous awards for excellence and received funding from the American Library Association, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the DuPont Foundation, and the Library of Congress.</p>
				<p>I'm now working with the Harvard Graduate School of Education to produce&nbsp;<a href="https://agileteacher.org/grace/about.htm" target="_blank">Teaching with Grace</a>, an AI-based tool for teacher-training simulation.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>And of course, doing marquetry using lasers and CNCs...</p>
